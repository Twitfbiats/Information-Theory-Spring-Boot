# Introduction

This is just a simple project for my **Information Theory** course, there were 2 exercises and they are hosted using **Spring Framework**.

# Ex1

You were given a matrix of size mxn which is the distribution of 2 variables x and y. You need to calculate their entropy, conditional entropy and other stuffs relate to entropy.

# Ex2

You have a text and you need to encode it using Huffman and Shannon Fano encoding scheme.

You can use older java version but you need to switch Spring Boot version.

# How to run

clone the project to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/Twitfbiats/Information-Theory-Spring-Boot.git
